## Before You Dive In

⚠️ **Fair warning:** I used a lot of AI (GPT-5-Codex, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro) to help write parts of this project.

It means some sections of the code are... well, a bit weird. You might find parts that are hard to read or don't really make sense at first glance. It works, but it's not always pretty or easy to follow.

I absolutely still welcome pull requests! Just wanted you to know what you might be getting into when digging through the source. Any help refactoring these bits to make them more human readable would be amazing.
